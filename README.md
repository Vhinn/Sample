# Sample
Sample Code; Sorting 


Code performing the following processes:

1) Reads an input.txt through console argument*
2) Converts contents into an array of integers A
3) States execution time of above (That is, time it takes to read and convert)
4) Sorts A using Count Sort
5) States execution time of Count Sort on A and outputs the sorted elements
6) Sorts A using Quick Sort
7) States execution time of Quick Sort on A and outputs the sorted elements




*Initially, the path was hardcoded- I figured it would be most flexible if I changed it to a console argument.

Of course, the path string could always hardcoded yet again in the program
